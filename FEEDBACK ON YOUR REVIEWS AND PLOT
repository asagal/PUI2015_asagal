Anastasia these reviews were very insightful and details. Good job on this. I think you could have done well in the class if you had been able to do the work and keep up. 10/10


NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================
the ticks and axis labels are too small 

the choice of binning is exceedingly small: this affects readability of the x axis and actually suggests the presence of structure that is not in the data (see Bayesian blocks for choosing binning size)

the x tick labels should be integers, not floats as they are birth years and there is no more granularity than year-level

a typo in the title should be corrected and the title should be more concise: that level of description is distracting and belongs to the caption. 

a compressed notation for the large numbers on the y axis would enhance readability



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


dperl

============
while esthetically appealing, plotting such large datasets with points is confusing and does not allow easy comparison and assessment of the value of the data. 
(e.g. what does the largest duration for female riders correspond to? somewhere around 1978 but it is hard to be more precise)

the datapoints hide a pattern in the data: the age increases more significantly for women, peaking around 1980, but it is hard to tell.

the purple foreground datapoints hide the background yellow datapoints -> confusion and ambiguity. 

tick labels are too small

the y axis in seconds offers unnecessary granularity: minutes would be better and more readable. even hours.



lanimc
============


the points are green but the legend is blue.

it is not clear what the legend means: it probably means the size corresponds to the duration, but this is just an educated guess as the nothing in the legend refers to size

the color is unexplained and appears to be redundant with the size

tick labels are way too small

large values on the y axis should be substituted by a compact notation (eg using units of 1000 trips)


MFilippelli
======
the station id is a categorical value, not a continuous one, so it should not be plotted as a position (and the idea of doing a regression on it is odd and really meaningless)

the regression lines are very thick, which does not add to readability. 

  
in color-blind simulations the colors become indistinguishable, particularly the green
