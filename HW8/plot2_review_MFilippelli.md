Clarity: The x-axis is clearly labeled. The y-axis has a legend, however, the viewer may get confused which station id corresponds to the dots, for example in the lower left corner of the plot where the dots are densely concentrated.

Aesthetic: The choice of colors is clear and distinguishable.

Honesty: Not clear which station id's correspond to the dots.

Suggestions: Include a title and legend to explain the color behind the dots.
