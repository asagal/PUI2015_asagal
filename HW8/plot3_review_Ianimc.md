Clarity: The size of the circles make it clear that the longest trip duration tend to happen before 8:00 AM. However, the viewer is unsure if the shade color (light green to dark green) has any additional meaning or if the the shade and circle size mean the same thing. 

Aesthetic:The visual layout is clear and uncluttered. Grid lines help the viewer. Not sure what the blue color of the circle in the legend means. 

Honesty: The breakdown of the x-axis makes it easy to understand when trips occur. However, it's not clear what time duration each circle size represents. 

Suggestions: Describe the meaning of circle size and shade in a legend. For example, provide a size range and the corresponding time range the circles represent. Additionally, including the year for the data in the title may help inform the viewer.
