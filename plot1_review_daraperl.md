Clarity: The plot has a clear title and the axis are labeled clearly. However, on the x-axis, there do not seem to be any data plotted from 1880 to early 1990, so it's not clear why 1880 is the start point.

Aesthetic: The colors of the circles are easy to distinguish. However, not sure about the interpretation of the double circles in the legend.

Honesty:In the bottom section of the plot where the data are densely concentrated, it is not clear if the purple circles may be covering some of the gold circles. If so, then the viewer doesn't see the true distribution of the yellow circles.

Suggestions: Include one circle per gender in the legend. Revise starting point of x-axis if there is no data in that interval. Consider reviewing data in the heavily concentrated areas to see if purple or yellow dots are blocking each other.
